## Overview

**Eco Plan-it** is designed to promote sustainable travel by providing customized routes ranked by eco-friendliness and carbon footprint. Users earn carbon credits when they choose eco-friendly modes of transportation and spend credits when opting for less sustainable options like cars. The app also suggests interesting eco-friendly activities along your route, such as visiting a local flower shop or a community garden.

This project is developed for the **2024 SoCal Hackathon**.
